Hello Team,

My name is Omolayo Odupe and currently undergoing the Fontend Track program with Dufuna Fem Code Camp.

At the end of this program i should be able to write code for webisite and application development using programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript 

Am excited, this will be a thrilling experience for me.

Thank you.

Looking forward to this.
