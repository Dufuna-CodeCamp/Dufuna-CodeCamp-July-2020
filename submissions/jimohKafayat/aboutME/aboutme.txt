At the end of this program, I hope to fully understand front end and back end development skill and be able to apply the knowledge I gain from this course in a Tech field by God's grace, and probably call myself a Fullstack Track Developer and hopefull I'll be eligible for a job as a Developer. Thanks to DufunaFemCodeCamp for giving me this great opportunity.
